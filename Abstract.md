Abstract
---------
Our canon will be focusing on the pros and cons of free trade for developing countries. First we will describe the basic concepts of free trade, such as the Hecksher-Ohlin model and Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, and a short historical overview of the development of these concepts. Next we will give an overview of relevant literature on the topic. We will use this material to answer our key questions on this topic.

- Does free trade stimulate economic growth in developing countries?
- And what role has FDI to play?
- Moreover, have international agreements relating free trade proven its worth?
- Until what extent does free trade blocks higher technology industrialization in subdeveloped and developing countries?
- exchange rates
